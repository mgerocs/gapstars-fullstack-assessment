## How to install
- Run `yarn install` from both the `/server` and `/client` folders.
- (Note: Using `npm install` I encountered this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79376487/trying-to-create-react-app-with-react-v19-0-0-but-getting-error, so I just went with yarn instead.)

## How to run
- Run `yarn run start` from the `/server` folder.
- Open a new terminal and run `yarn run start` from the `/client` folder.
