## How to install
- Run `yarn install` from both the `/server` and `/client` folders.
- (Note: Using `npm intall` I encountered this issue: [https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32016](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79376487/trying-to-create-react-app-with-react-v19-0-0-but-getting-error), so I just went with yarn instead.)

## How to run
- Run `yarn run startÂ´ from the `/server`folder.
- Open a new terminal and run `yarn run start`from the `/client`folder.
